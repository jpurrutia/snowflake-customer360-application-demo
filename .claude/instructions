# Security Guardrails for Claude Code

## NEVER read these files without explicit user permission:
- ~/.snowsql/config
- ~/.aws/credentials
- ~/.ssh/*
- **/secrets.toml
- **/.env
- ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
- **/credentials.json
- **/*.pem
- **/*.key

## Before reading ANY configuration file that may contain credentials:
Ask: "This file may contain credentials. Should I read it, or would you prefer to manually provide the information?"

## NEVER write credentials directly to files:
- If credentials are needed, suggest environment variables
- Suggest user manually updates files with sensitive data
- Use placeholder values like "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE" or "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN"

## If credentials are accidentally exposed:
1. Immediately stop and warn the user
2. Suggest rotating/changing the credential or appropriate secrete depending on context
3. Do not reference, copy, or use the credential in any subsequent operations

## Prefer secure alternatives:
- SSO/browser authentication over passwords
- Environment variables over hardcoded values
- Secrets management tools over plain text configuration
- User-managed credential files over AI-written ones
